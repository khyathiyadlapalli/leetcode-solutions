# Happy Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:


	Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
	Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
	Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.


Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1


Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 231 - 1

class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:

        slow = n
        fast = n

        while fast != 1:

            slow = self.getNext(slow)
            fast = self.getNext(self.getNext(fast))

            if slow == fast:
                return False

        return True

    def getNext(self, n):
        total = 0

        while n > 0:
            digit = n % 10
            total += digit * digit
            n = n // 10

        return total
```
