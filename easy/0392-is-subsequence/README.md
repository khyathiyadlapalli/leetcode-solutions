# Is Subsequence

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

 
Constraints:


	0 <= s.length <= 100
	0 <= t.length <= 104
	s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.


 
Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

                i+=1
            j+=1
        return i==len(s)
